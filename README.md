# post-based-social-prototype
My learning and testing project with Spring + Angular in a context of post based social media (posts CRUD, subscriptions on users, utility around it all).

 Currently in need of refactoring and change of logic in a lot of things (id assignment, caching, tokens' life cycle and storage, overall angular structure, corrections to closely and correctly follow reactive design in angular, garbage code removal, etc.)

 Removed google client-id and client-secret from application.yml (must be filled in order to run the application).
